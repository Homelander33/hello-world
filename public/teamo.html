        <!-- Hey there! I just wondered whether you would wondered and check this out, therefore those unnecesary clicks (google analytics) and making you the only contact on my mexican whatsapp so no one else with mexican IP would show up in the log. 
I understand that a lot of time has passed and the water in river is diferrent now, nonetheless somehow I still think of you and miss you. I know it's irrelevant to you, you're bussy, have Mia and perhaps someone else, haven't forgiven me for how I treated you or just don't wanna waste your time  on me, or perhaps combination of all those things, it's understandable.
 I just hope you are doing fine and hopefully we will talk some day again.
       Btw somehow you getting into an IT inspired me to give it a go too and star learning for real this time...finally after 10 years...so thanks for that and take care :-) -->
